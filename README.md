# Unpick

Unpick is a minimal Java constant uninlining library. It depends only on ObjectWeb ASM. WeaveMC only existed for interim 
management of the project until Fabric was in a suitable state to integrate it directly into the toolchain. As such,  [FabricMC/unpick](https://github.com/FabricMC/unpick) is the successor to this project. This project now exists only for historical reasons.
